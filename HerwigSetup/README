CONTENT OF THE MINIMAL SETUP

Generic/		contains the runcard, amplitudes and event generator run by Herwig
Settings/		contains a setupfile where you can change parameters unrelated to the hard scattering
			(shower parameters, hadronization...)
scan/			contains the tuning parameter space points, values to which are given in the params.dat
			file (like in Professor)
linscan.py		Helper script to create the scan/ directory
options.in		Options (c.o.m energy, PDFs, scale choices, routines...) separated by a tab
default_params.dat	The default parameters for alpha(shower), ClMaxLight and PSplitLight
Herwig7Generate.py	Head script: create the job options files automatically and submit them


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To produce the files and generate the events on the cluster, do the following:

1) Move to Generic/ and modifiy the runcard "MC_Herwig_..._.in" to your liking. The name must be of the type

	MC_Herwig_"ORDER"_"Ecm"_"SCALE"_"PDF"_"SHOWER""MATCHING"_"TOPMASS".in
	tT_matchbox_"ORDER"_"Ecm"_"SCALE"_"PDF"_"SHOWER""MATCHING"_"TOPMASS"

for the run card and the event generator's name (last line in the runcard), respectively.

2) If you've modified anything related to the hard scattering, you have to re-integrate the generated amplitudes.
   Run "Herwig read MC_Herwig_..._.in" to create the event generator (which ends in .run).

3) If you've chosen parameters for the tune, generate the scan/ directory by running the linScan.py script.
   Note that if you don't use the same parameters as in the linScan.py and Herwig7Generate.py scripts, you have
   to add them there (that is if you want to tune another parameter than alpha_s(shower), ClMaxLight and PSplitLight).

Note: if you want the default parameters (for example if you only want to change the PDF or the scale, but not scan
      the parameter space), you can simply use the default_params.dat file and put it in

	scan/0/params.dat

4) Modify the options.in script to your liking. The analyses IDs and the cross-sections must NOT change lines.

5) Modify the first lines in Herwig7Generate.py to your Herwig installation path, and custom analyses path. Change
   the number of events per job and the number of jobs.

6) python Herwig7Generate.py
